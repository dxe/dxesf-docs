# Bylaws

## Preamble

These Bylaws aim to:

1. reduce conflict between and within operational teams, by creating a coherent decision-making and staffing process;
2. allow us to move forward even in the face of disagreement, by providing democratic legitimacy to decisions and leadership;
3. promote accountability in our commitments to ourselves and organizational partners by empowering the leadership team to align our work with our roadmap and annual strategic plan; and
4. provide for transparency and checks and balances by which leadership can be selected, recalled, and decisions revisited.

They will also set the hour and place of meetings, make recommendations to the Chapter, and perform any other duties as specified in these bylaws.

The first hour of regular meetings is reserved for executive session.

## Committees and Working Groups

### Committees

The Lead Organizer suggests and has final say over the composition of a set of Committees (including Communications, Community, Development, Direct Action, Finance, and any others deemed necessary).
Committees are focused on DxE's core functions, are expressly tasked with pushing forward on DxE's annual strategy and its 40 year roadmap, and are empowered to make decisions on resources.
Committee members will be appointed based on expertise, culture fit, and team effectiveness, and team size will generally be limited to 7, unless exceptional circumstances justify a larger team.

### Working Groups

The Lead Organizer has final say over the [composition of official Working Groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUybB0HQwd5pEJ2t5-uziFSlTGaExSyx3_iTIQf_HE4/preview).
Working Groups will determine their own processes and meeting schedules, and will coordinate with other Working Groups via a designated Committee.
Where there is no request for funds/resources or conflict between Working Groups or conflict with the chapter strategy, Working Groups can continue to work autonomously.

Working Groups can choose to remain unofficial and therefore completely independent if they do not seek DxE resources and mailing lists.
The DxE SF Bay Area chapter will work with unofficial Working Groups on the basis of free association.
Conflicts between Working Groups will be resolved by the Lead Organizer in consultation with the relevant Committees.

### Membership Standards

The point person for a Committee or Working Group may impose reasonable requirements for training, agreements, work standards, and rules of order for that Committee or Working Group.

### Resources

Requests for resources must be directed to the Lead Organizer or relevant Committee.
The Lead Organizer has final say over allocation of resources.

### Removal of Working Groups

An official Working Group will be dissolved or become unofficial if the group fails to meet the relevant standards, violates DxE's values, or for any other good faith reason (e.g. redundancy, conflict with other Working Groups) set out by the Lead Organizer or relevant Committee lead.

### Removal of Working Group Members

Members of official Working Groups may be removed due to violations of DxE's values, [code of conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1bSO9UCCgifH0UZfsfZ-5CEqtUOQ7tXL5lBmJoE9w4/preview), failure to meet relevant standards, or any other good faith reason (e.g. redundancy, conflict with other Working Groups) set out by the Lead Organizer, relevant Committee lead, or relevant Working Group point person.

### List of Working Groups

The SF Bay Core must keep a list of official Working Groups, Chapter Members, Organizers and Senior Organizers.

## Parliamentary Authority

The rules contained in the 11th edition of *Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised* will govern the Chapter in all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with these bylaws and any [special rules of order](special-rules.md) the Chapter may adopt.

## Amendment of Bylaws

These bylaws may be amended at any regular Chapter meeting by a 2/3 vote, provided that the amendment was submitted in writing at the previous regular meeting.
