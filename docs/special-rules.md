# Special Rules of Order

## Electronic Meetings

The SF Bay Core may allow meeting participation by audio- or video-conferencing.

## Proxy Voting

If a Chapter Member will be absent for a scheduled vote, they may designate another member as proxy to vote on their behalf.
To do so, they must notify the Secretary at least an hour before the meeting is called to order.

To serve as a proxy, the designated member must be eligible to vote on the question themselves.
Also, a member cannot serve as proxy for more than one member for the same vote.

## Voting Cards

Voting cards may be used as a voting method at Chapter meetings whenever a rising vote is in order.
