# Special Rules of Order

## 1. Electronic Meetings

The SF Bay Core may allow meeting participation by audio- or video-conferencing.

### 1.1 Electronic Speaking Queue

**Requesting to Speak:** During an electronic meeting, any member wishing to
speak shall type a single asterisk (`*`) in the meeting chat. The facilitator
(or a designated co-host) will monitor the chat to note the order in which
asterisks appear. The facilitator will recognize members to speak in this order.

**Comments vs. Speaking**: If a member types an asterisk immediately followed by
a comment (e.g., “* I support this proposal but have a concern…”), the
facilitator will read the comment on their behalf instead of recognizing the
member to speak. This is useful for brief clarifications or statements that do
not require taking the floor.

**Interrupting Motions**: If a member needs to raise a motion that is allowed to
interrupt under Robert’s Rules of Order (e.g., a Point of Order, Point of
Privilege), they may type “* Point of Order” (or the appropriate motion) or
otherwise indicate their intent. The facilitator shall promptly determine if the
motion is in order and, if so, grant that member the floor immediately, outside
the normal queue.

## 2. Speaking limits

During discussion items, individual speeches shall generally be limited to
two (2) minutes.

There shall be no limit on the number of times someone can speak.

Speaking limits do not apply while a member is delivering a report but shall
apply to any discussion following the report.

A *Motion to Limit or Extend Limits of Debate* may still change these limits.

## 3. Proxy Voting

If a Chapter Member will be absent for a scheduled vote, they may designate another member as proxy to vote on their behalf.
To do so, they must notify the Secretary at least an hour before the meeting is called to order.

To serve as a proxy, the designated member must be eligible to vote on the question themselves.
Also, a member cannot serve as proxy for more than one member for the same vote.

For quorum, a proxy counts both for themselves and for the member they are serving.

## 4. Electronic Voting

Votes may be taken electronically, but their defining characteristics must be preserved.
For example, if a ballot vote is taken electronically, members' votes must still be kept secret.

The Secretary shall be responsible for operating the voting system and ensuring
that all votes are conducted in accordance with these principles.

## 5. Notetaking

The facilitator shall appoint a chapter member to take meeting notes before
each meeting. This role is not limited to the secretary.
